<h2 class="faqh2">Overview</h2>
<dl class="faq mb30">

<a name="q01"></a>
<dt>What is Alzheimer's Disease?</dt>
<dd>
Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia in which generalized degeneration of the brain causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks.
</dd>

<a name="q02"></a>
<dt>How common is Alzheimer's Disease?</dt>
<dd>An estimated 5.4 million Americans of all ages have Alzheimer's disease in 2016. Of the 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer's, an estimated 5.2 million people are age 65 and older, and approximately 200,000 individuals are under age 65 (younger-onset Alzheimer's). This number is projected to triple by the year 2050.</dd>


<a name="q022"></a>
<dt>What is the MIND Diet?</dt>
<dd>"The MIND diet, short for the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, has been directly linked to a significant improvement in neurological function. What does this mean for you? 
Through an extensive research trial, scientists at Rush University Medical Center found that following this diet can reduce your risk of Alzheimer's and dementia by up to 53%!  Even moderately following the diet reduces your risk by over a third. The diet focuses on 10 brain-healthy foods including leafy greens, nuts and limits potentially damaging foods like red meat, pastries, and fried foods. In addition to reducing incidence of Alzheimer’s disease, following the MIND diet has also been linked to lower risk of cardiovascular conditions like hypertension, heart attack and stroke."</dd>

<a name="q0222"></a>
<dt>Is there research to back the MIND Diet's claim on reducing risk of dementia and Alzheimer's?</dt>
<dd>Yes. The MIND Trial was conducted by Dr. Morris and her team in which over 900 Chicago area seniors were followed over an average of 4.5 years. A comprehensive questionnaire was used to collect data on participant dietary patterns and yearly cognitive tests were performed. The study found the MIND diet lowered Alzheimer’s risk by about 35% amongst those who followed it moderately well and up to 53% for those who stricktly adhered to the diet. Other large studies have also found significant links between the consumption of specific MIND Diet foods like leafy greens and brain health.</dd>
