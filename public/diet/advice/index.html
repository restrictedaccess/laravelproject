<dd><b>4. </b>How do you know if your bread is whole grain? Check out the label. Look for the yellow whole grain symbol that says 100%. </dd>		<br />					
<dd>How much sugar are you eating? When only 4 grams of sugar = 1 teaspoon, things add up fast.  Example: Drinking 1 can soda per day  =  10 tsp sugar per day and over 30 pounds of sugar per year. Wow!</dd> 				<br />			
<dd><b>5. </b>Turkey beats red meat.  Love chili, burgers and other beef casserole dishes? Try subbing with ground turkey! 	</dd>	<br />					
<dd><b>6. </b>Trouble limiting sweets? Try saving your treat for the evening.  Eating sweets early in the day generally leads to more sweets later.</dd>	 	<br />						
<dd>	<b>7. </b>Sweet tooth? Try making fruit popsicles out of the ENTIRE fruit.  Try this delicious recipe:<br /> 				<a href="http://theviewfromgreatisland.com/whole-fruit-popsicles/ " target="_blank" >http://theviewfromgreatisland.com/whole-fruit-popsicles/ </a>	</dd><br />

<dd><b>8. </b>Having trouble getting enough vegetables? Remember fermented vegetables count too! They are also fantastic for your gut. Try this easy sauerkraut recipe.

<dd><b>9. </b>	Whats the secret to a moist, delicious cake? Olive oil!  Try this in place of vegetable oil. You will be amazed at the results. : 	</dd>			<br />			
<dd><b>10. </b>	Wheat bread is a good choice,  but it might not be "whole grain".  Many wheat and multigrain breads have a combintaion of refined AND whole grain flour. Look for "100% whole grain" on the packaging. Questions? Ask your coach! 	</dd>	<br />					
<dd><b>11. </b>	Food prep hard to manage? Wash and chop a variety of veges (1x/week so you can quickly throw them into omelets, stirfrys, crockpots and casseroles. 	</dd>	<br />

<h2>Behavior Change Tips</h2>
<dd><b>1. </b>	Personal mantras can help motivate and inspire you to be your best. Create a positive and powerful statement to help you reach your goals.  Example: I can and I will.  	</dd>	<br />		
<dd><b>2. </b>	Setting goals can be a powerful tool to inspire change. Remember, small changes lead to big ones.  	</dd>	<br />		
<dd><b>3. </b>	Finding it tough to  achieve your goals? Try to find a "keystone habit".  Keystone habits have a very powerful ripple effect in your life, helping you to reach your goals . Ex: When I exercise in the morning, I tend to eat healthy all day.  When I eat healthy, I have more energy and perform better at work.   This decreases work stress, helping me to sleep better. And so on..... 	</dd><br />		
<dd><b>4. </b>		Build an environment that allows good habits to thrive.  A few examples: Try to avoid driving by your favorite fast food restaurant, especially when you are hungry.  Join a gym that has multiple locations making getting in your exercise even easier.  Keep healthy stacks stocked in your purse or car if your schedule throws you a lot of curve balls that tend to mess up your nutrition goals. 						</dd><br />		
<dd><b>5. </b>	Going out to eat? Try eating an apple on the way. This helps to take the hunger "edge" off, helping you make better choices once you arrive. 					 						</dd><br />
